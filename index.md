#How can we start to access the sgtcloud from the html5-sdk?
Run start.bat under Windows, it will start a py web server and you can have fun with sgtcloud at once.
If you are under linux or mac, you may copy all files in example and move them to your local web server. We would provide a shortcut in later release.
